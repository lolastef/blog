Hey guys! Hope you're having great holidays! I'm spending mine in the south of France near Montpellier. Yesterday, I had the chance to lunch at La MAISON de Petit Pierre in Béziers. It's a cozy restaurant owned by a genuine chief. Everything tasted so good, I had a really great time!

You guys are craving, am I right?
Let's talk about fashion...

I wanted a colorful outfit. This summer, I'm all about bright colors, just like the music video 'Feels' by C. Harris.

I decided to wear a green blouse from Madvintage, pink pants à volants 'italique' from Stradivarius, magenta shoes from ASOS, my little Gucci bag and some accessories.

So sad, I only found similar items!! You'll find all the links down below.
